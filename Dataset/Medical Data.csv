0,Atrial fibrillation,"In a typical heart, a tiny group of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal. The signal travels through the heart's upper chambers to the atrioventricular (AV) node. The signal then passes into the lower heart chambers, causing them to squeeze and pump out blood. In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from many locations in the upper chambers, causing them to beat chaotically. Since the AV node doesn't prevent all of these chaotic signals from entering the lower chambers, the heart beats faster and irregularly.","Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations.Chest pain.Dizziness.Fatigue.Lightheadedness.Reduced ability to exercise.Shortness of breath.Weakness.",Symptoms of AFib may include:
1,Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when a lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta, becomes weakened and bulges.","Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly.Back pain.A pulse near the bellybutton.","Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. This makes them difficult to detect. Some aneurysms never rupture. Many start small and stay small. Others grow larger over time, sometimes quickly."
2,Hyperhidrosis,Hyperhidrosis (hi-pur-hi-DROE-sis) is excessive sweating that's not always related to heat or exercise. You may sweat so much that it soaks through your clothes or drips off your hands. Heavy sweating can disrupt your day and cause social anxiety and embarrassment.,Sweating disrupts your daily routineSweating causes emotional distress or social withdrawalYou suddenly begin to sweat more than usualYou experience night sweats for no apparent reason,"The main symptom of hyperhidrosis is heavy sweating. This goes beyond the sweating from being in a hot environment, exercising, or feeling anxious or stressed. The type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week when you're awake. And the sweating usually happens on both sides of the body."
3,Absence seizure,"Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They're more common in children than in adults.",A sudden stop in activity without falling.Lip smacking.Eyelid flutters.Chewing motions.Finger rubbing.Small movements of both hands.,"A simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds. There's no confusion, headache or drowsiness after the seizure."
4,Achalasia,Achalasia is a rare disorder that makes it difficult for food and liquid to pass from the swallowing tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus) into your stomach.,"Inability to swallow (dysphagia), which may feel like food or drink is stuck in your throatRegurgitating food or salivaHeartburnBelchingChest pain that comes and goesCoughing at nightPneumonia (from aspiration of food into the lungs)Weight lossVomiting",Achalasia symptoms generally appear gradually and worsen over time. Signs and symptoms may include:
5,Achilles tendon rupture,"The Achilles tendon is a strong fibrous cord that connects the muscles in the back of your calf to your heel bone. If you overstretch your Achilles tendon, it can tear (rupture).","The feeling of having been kicked in the calfPain, possibly severe, and swelling near the heelAn inability to bend the foot downward or ""push off"" the injured leg when walkingAn inability to stand on the toes on the injured legA popping or snapping sound when the injury occurs","Although it's possible to have no signs or symptoms with an Achilles tendon rupture, most people have:"
6,Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),"Acid reflux occurs when the sphincter muscle at the lower end of your esophagus relaxes at the wrong time, allowing stomach acid to back up into your esophagus. This can cause heartburn and other signs and symptoms. Frequent or constant reflux can lead to GERD.","A burning sensation in your chest (heartburn), usually after eating, which might be worse at night or while lying downBackwash (regurgitation) of food or sour liquidUpper abdominal or chest painTrouble swallowing (dysphagia)Sensation of a lump in your throat",Common signs and symptoms of GERD include:
7,Infant reflux,"If the muscle between the esophagus and the stomach relaxes when the stomach is full, food might flow up the baby's esophagus. This muscle is called the lower esophageal sphincter.","Isn't gaining weight.Consistently spits up forcefully, causing stomach contents to shoot out of the mouth. This is called projectile vomiting.Spits up green or yellow fluid.Spits up blood or stomach contents that look like coffee grounds.Refuses to feed or eat.Has blood in the stool.Has difficulty breathing or a cough that won't go away.Begins spitting up at age 6 months or older.Is unusually irritable after eating.Doesn't have much energy.","In most cases, infant reflux isn't a cause for concern. It's unusual for stomach contents to have enough acid to irritate the throat or esophagus and cause symptoms."
8,ACL injury,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the key ligaments that help stabilize the knee joint. The ACL connects the thighbone (femur) to the shinbone (tibia).

11,Acoustic neuroma,"An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a noncancerous tumor. It develops on the balance nerve, known as the vestibular nerve, and on the auditory nerve, known as the cochlear nerve. These nerves lead from your inner ear to the brain, as shown in the top image. The pressure on the nerve from the tumor may cause hearing loss and imbalance. In some cases, the tumor may grow and affect the cerebellum or other brain tissues, as shown in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and illustrations above.","Hearing loss, usually gradually over months to years. In rare cases, hearing loss can be sudden. Hearing loss usually occurs on one side or is worse on one side.Ringing in the affected ear, known as tinnitus.Loss of balance or not feeling steady.Dizziness.Facial numbness and, very rarely, weakness or loss of muscle movement.","Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. Symptoms may occur because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves. The tumor also can put pressure on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles, known as the facial nerve, and sensation, known as the trigeminal nerve. Blood vessels or brain structures also can be affected by an acoustic neuroma."

Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis."
17,Acute kidney failure,"The kidneys remove waste and excess fluid from the blood through structures called nephrons. Each nephron contains a filter called a glomerulus that has a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. When blood flows into a glomerulus, tiny molecules — water, essential minerals and nutrients, and wastes — pass through the capillary walls. Large molecules, such as proteins and red blood cells, do not. The filtered solution then passes into another part of the nephron called the tubule. The water, nutrients and minerals that the body needs are transferred back to the bloodstream. The excess water and waste become urine that flows to the bladder.","Decreased urine output, although occasionally urine output remains normalFluid retention, causing swelling in your legs, ankles or feetShortness of breathFatigueConfusionNauseaWeaknessIrregular heartbeatChest pain or pressureSeizures or coma in severe cases",Signs and symptoms of acute kidney failure may include:

143,Atrial fibrillation,"In a typical heart, a tiny group of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal. The signal travels through the heart's upper chambers to the atrioventricular (AV) node. The signal then passes into the lower heart chambers, causing them to squeeze and pump out blood. In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from many locations in the upper chambers, causing them to beat chaotically. Since the AV node doesn't prevent all of these chaotic signals from entering the lower chambers, the heart beats faster and irregularly.","Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations.Chest pain.Dizziness.Fatigue.Lightheadedness.Reduced ability to exercise.Shortness of breath.Weakness.",Symptoms of AFib may include:

157,Bad breath,"The microscopic uneven surface of the tongue can trap bacteria that produce odors, contributing to bad breath.
","Food.The breakdown of food particles in and around your teeth can increase bacteria and cause a foul odor. Eating certain foods, such as onions, garlic and spices, also can cause bad breath. After you digest these foods, they enter your bloodstream, are carried to your lungs and affect your breath.Tobacco products.Smoking causes its own unpleasant mouth odor. Smokers and oral tobacco users are also more likely to have gum disease, another source of bad breath.Poor dental hygiene.If you don't brush and floss daily, food particles remain in your mouth, causing bad breath. A colorless, sticky film of bacteria (plaque) forms on your teeth. If not brushed away, plaque can irritate your gums and eventually form plaque-filled pockets between your teeth and gums (periodontitis). Your tongue also can trap bacteria that produce odors. Dentures that aren't cleaned regularly or don't fit properly can harbor odor-causing bacteria and food particles.Dry mouth.Saliva helps cleanse your mouth, removing particles that cause bad odors. A condition called dry mouth or xerostomia (zeer–o-STOE-me-uh) can contribute to bad breath because production of saliva is decreased. Dry mouth naturally occurs during sleep, leading to ""morning breath,"" and it worsens if you sleep with your mouth open. Chronic dry mouth can be caused by a problem with your salivary glands and some diseases.Medications.Some medications can indirectly produce bad breath by contributing to dry mouth. Others can be broken down in the body to release chemicals that can be carried on your breath.Infections in your mouth.Bad breath can be caused by surgical wounds after oral surgery, such as tooth removal, or as a result of tooth decay, gum disease or mouth sores.Other mouth, nose and throat conditions.Bad breath can occasionally stem from small stones that form in the tonsils and are covered with bacteria that produce odor. Infections or chronic inflammation in the nose, sinuses or throat, which can contribute to postnasal drip, also can cause bad breath.Other causes.Diseases, such as some cancers, and conditions such as metabolic disorders, can cause a distinctive breath odor as a result of chemicals they produce. Chronic reflux of stomach acids (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can be associated with bad breath. Bad breath in young children can be caused by a foreign body, such as a piece of food, lodged in a nostril.","Bad breath odors vary, depending on the source or the underlying cause. Some people worry too much about their breath even though they have little or no mouth odor, while others have bad breath and don't know it. Because it's difficult to assess how your own breath smells, ask a close friend or relative to confirm your bad-breath questions."

Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out.Sudden loosening of hair.A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary.Full-body hair loss.Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back.Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp.This is a sign of ringworm.

Others may lose small to moderate amounts of urine more frequently."
187,Bladder exstrophy,"In girls born with bladder exstrophy, the bladder is on the outside of the body and the vagina is not fully formed. Surgeons will close the bladder (top right) and then close the abdomen and skin (bottom right).","Epispadias.This is the least severe form ofBEEC, in which the tube to expel urine (urethra) doesn't fully develop.Bladder exstrophy.This defect causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body. The bladder is also turned inside out. Usually, bladder exstrophy will involve organs of the urinary tract, as well as the digestive and reproductive systems. Defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitals, pelvic bones, final section of the large intestine (rectum) and opening at the end of the rectum (anus) can occur.Children with bladder exstrophy also have vesicoureteral reflux. This condition causes urine to flow the wrong way — from the bladder back up into the tubes that connect to the kidneys (ureters). Children with bladder exstrophy also have epispadias.Cloacal exstrophy.Cloacal exstrophy (kloe-A-kul EK-stroh-fee) is the most serious form ofBEEC. In this condition, the rectum, bladder and genitals don't fully separate as the fetus develops. These organs may not be correctly formed, and the pelvic bones are affected as well.The kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected. Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal abnormalities, including spina bifida. Children born with protruding abdominal organs probably also have cloacal exstrophy or bladder exstrophy.",Bladder exstrophy is the most common in the larger group of birth defects called the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). Children with BEEC have one of the following:
188,Cystitis,Cystitis (sis-TIE-tis) is the medical term for inflammation of the bladder. Inflammation is when a part of your body is swollen and hot.

When signs and symptoms occur, they may include:"
190,Ureteral obstruction,"Your urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine. The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper abdomen. They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine. Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate. Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra.",PainChanges in how much urine you produce (urine output)Difficulty urinatingBlood in the urineUrinary tract infectionsHigh blood pressure (hypertension),"Ureteral obstruction might have no signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms depend on where the obstruction occurs, whether it's partial or complete, how quickly it develops, and whether it affects one or both kidneys."
191,Blood in urine (hematuria),"It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. In many cases, the cause is harmless. But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.","Urinary tract infections (UTIs).These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder.UTIscan cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With aUTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too.Kidney infection.This type ofUTIalso is called pyelonephritis.Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that otherUTIscan. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin.A bladder or kidney stone.The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones.The stones are often painless. But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab.Enlarged prostate.The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms.Kidney disease.Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed.Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes. Or it can happen on its own.Cancer.Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better.Inherited illnesses.A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine.Kidney injury.A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine.Medicines. The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause.Hard exercise.Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football. It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit. Blood in urine also can happen with long-distance sports, such as marathon running, but it's less clear why. It may be linked to bladder damage or other reasons that don't involve an injury. When hard exercise causes blood in urine, it may go away on its own within a week.If you see blood in your urine after exercise, don't assume it's from exercising. See your health care provider.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red."

It may happen when you're bored or during a task. For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly fall asleep. It can be especially dangerous if you fall asleep while driving. You might fall asleep for only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, you'll often feel refreshed but you'll get sleepy again.You also may experience a decrease in how alert and focused you feel during the day. Daytime sleepiness often is the first symptom to appear. Feeling sleepy makes it hard to focus and function.Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, you may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. You might continue to perform that task while asleep. When you awaken, you can't remember what you did, and you probably didn't do it well.Sudden loss of muscle tone.This condition is called cataplexy.

Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, you might feel as if there is a stranger in your bedroom. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming.Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REMsleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enterREMsleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly toREMsleep.

It may happen when you're bored or during a task. For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly fall asleep. It can be especially dangerous if you fall asleep while driving. You might fall asleep for only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, you'll often feel refreshed but you'll get sleepy again.You also may experience a decrease in how alert and focused you feel during the day. Daytime sleepiness often is the first symptom to appear. Feeling sleepy makes it hard to focus and function.Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly.

Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, you might feel as if there is a stranger in your bedroom. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming.Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REMsleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enterREMsleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly toREMsleep.

The pain is likely to be most severe within the first four to 12 hours after it begins.Lingering discomfort.After the most severe pain subsides, some joint discomfort may last from a few days to a few weeks. Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints.Inflammation and redness.The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red.Limited range of motion.As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally.",Gout causes intense pain and swelling around one or more joints. Gout most commonly affects the joint at the base of the big toe.
648,Granuloma annulare,"Granuloma annulare is a skin condition that causes a raised rash or bumps in a ring pattern, usually on the hands and feet.","Localized.This is the most common type of granuloma annulare. The rash borders are circular or semicircular, with a diameter up to 2 inches (5 centimeters). The rash occurs most commonly on the hands, feet, wrists and ankles of young adults.Generalized.This type is uncommon and usually affects adults. It causes bumps that form a rash on most of the body, including the trunk, arms and legs. The rash might cause discomfort or itchiness.Under the skin.A type that usually affects young children is called subcutaneous granuloma annulare. It produces small, firm lumps under the skin, instead of a rash. The lumps form on the hands, shins and scalp.","The signs and symptoms of granuloma annulare can vary, depending on the type:"
649,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is an uncommon disorder that causes inflammation of the blood vessels in your nose, sinuses, throat, lungs and kidneys.","Pus-like drainage with crusts from your nose, stuffiness, sinus infections and nosebleedsCoughing, sometimes with bloody phlegmShortness of breath or wheezingFeverFatigueJoint painNumbness in your limbs, fingers or toesWeight lossBlood in your urineSkin sores, bruising or rashesEye redness, burning or pain, and vision problemsEar inflammation and hearing problems","Signs and symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis can develop suddenly or over several months. The first warning signs usually involve your sinuses, throat or lungs. The condition often worsens rapidly, affecting blood vessels and the organs they supply, such as the kidneys."
650,Graves' disease,"The thyroid gland is located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple.","Anxiety and irritabilityA fine tremor of the hands or fingersHeat sensitivity and an increase in perspiration or warm, moist skinWeight loss, despite normal eating habitsEnlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter)Change in menstrual cyclesErectile dysfunction or reduced libidoFrequent bowel movementsBulging eyes (Graves' ophthalmopathy)FatigueThick, red skin usually on the shins or tops of the feet (Graves' dermopathy)Rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)Sleep disturbance",Widespread enlargement of the thyroid can expand the gland well beyond its typical size (left) and cause a noticeable bulge in the neck (right).
651,Complicated grief,"Losing a loved one is one of the most distressing and, unfortunately, common experiences people face. Most people experiencing normal grief and bereavement have a period of sorrow, numbness, and even guilt and anger. Gradually these feelings ease, and it's possible to accept loss and move forward.","Intense sorrow, pain and rumination over the loss of your loved oneFocus on little else but your loved one's deathExtreme focus on reminders of the loved one or excessive avoidance of remindersIntense and persistent longing or pining for the deceasedProblems accepting the deathNumbness or detachmentBitterness about your lossFeeling that life holds no meaning or purposeLack of trust in othersInability to enjoy life or think back on positive experiences with your loved one","During the first few months after a loss, many signs and symptoms of normal grief are the same as those of complicated grief. However, while normal grief symptoms gradually start to fade over time, those of complicated grief linger or get worse. Complicated grief is like being in an ongoing, heightened state of mourning that keeps you from healing."
652,Blood in urine (hematuria),"It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. In many cases, the cause is harmless. But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.","Urinary tract infections (UTIs).These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder.UTIscan cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With aUTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too.Kidney infection.This type ofUTIalso is called pyelonephritis.Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that otherUTIscan. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin.A bladder or kidney stone.The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones.The stones are often painless. But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab.Enlarged prostate.The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms.Kidney disease.Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed.Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes. Or it can happen on its own.Cancer.Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better.Inherited illnesses.A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine.Kidney injury.A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine.Medicines. The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause.Hard exercise.Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football. It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit. Blood in urine also can happen with long-distance sports, such as marathon running, but it's less clear why. It may be linked to bladder damage or other reasons that don't involve an injury. When hard exercise causes blood in urine, it may go away on its own within a week.If you see blood in your urine after exercise, don't assume it's from exercising. See your health care provider.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red."

662,Hair loss,"Hair loss (alopecia) can affect just your scalp or your entire body, and it can be temporary or permanent. It can be the result of heredity, hormonal changes, medical conditions or a normal part of aging. Anyone can lose hair on their head, but it's more common in men.","Gradual thinning on top of head.This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia).Circular or patchy bald spots.Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out.Sudden loosening of hair.A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary.Full-body hair loss.Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back.Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp.This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing.",Male-pattern baldness typically appears first at the hairline or top of the head.

Sometimes a health care provider finds it by accident during a blood test for another condition.
665,Black hairy tongue,"Black hairy tongue is caused by an overgrowth of dead skin cells, causing lengthening of the papillae, and staining from bacteria, yeast, food, tobacco or other substances in the mouth.","Black discoloration of the tongue, although the color may be brown, tan, green, yellow or whiteA hairy or furry appearance of the tongueAltered taste or metallic taste in your mouthBad breath (halitosis)Gagging or tickling sensation, if the overgrowth of the papillae is excessive",Signs and symptoms of black hairy tongue include:
666,Bad breath,"The microscopic uneven surface of the tongue can trap bacteria that produce odors, contributing to bad breath.
","Food.The breakdown of food particles in and around your teeth can increase bacteria and cause a foul odor. Eating certain foods, such as onions, garlic and spices, also can cause bad breath. After you digest these foods, they enter your bloodstream, are carried to your lungs and affect your breath.Tobacco products.Smoking causes its own unpleasant mouth odor. Smokers and oral tobacco users are also more likely to have gum disease, another source of bad breath.Poor dental hygiene.If you don't brush and floss daily, food particles remain in your mouth, causing bad breath. A colorless, sticky film of bacteria (plaque) forms on your teeth. If not brushed away, plaque can irritate your gums and eventually form plaque-filled pockets between your teeth and gums (periodontitis). Your tongue also can trap bacteria that produce odors. Dentures that aren't cleaned regularly or don't fit properly can harbor odor-causing bacteria and food particles.Dry mouth.Saliva helps cleanse your mouth, removing particles that cause bad odors. A condition called dry mouth or xerostomia (zeer–o-STOE-me-uh) can contribute to bad breath because production of saliva is decreased. Dry mouth naturally occurs during sleep, leading to ""morning breath,"" and it worsens if you sleep with your mouth open. Chronic dry mouth can be caused by a problem with your salivary glands and some diseases.Medications.Some medications can indirectly produce bad breath by contributing to dry mouth. Others can be broken down in the body to release chemicals that can be carried on your breath.Infections in your mouth.Bad breath can be caused by surgical wounds after oral surgery, such as tooth removal, or as a result of tooth decay, gum disease or mouth sores.Other mouth, nose and throat conditions.Bad breath can occasionally stem from small stones that form in the tonsils and are covered with bacteria that produce odor. Infections or chronic inflammation in the nose, sinuses or throat, which can contribute to postnasal drip, also can cause bad breath.Other causes.Diseases, such as some cancers, and conditions such as metabolic disorders, can cause a distinctive breath odor as a result of chemicals they produce. Chronic reflux of stomach acids (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can be associated with bad breath. Bad breath in young children can be caused by a foreign body, such as a piece of food, lodged in a nostril.","Bad breath odors vary, depending on the source or the underlying cause. Some people worry too much about their breath even though they have little or no mouth odor, while others have bad breath and don't know it. Because it's difficult to assess how your own breath smells, ask a close friend or relative to confirm your bad-breath questions."

This is especially true for people who try to go back to the same activities before the muscles have time to heal.Tired muscles, weak muscles and muscles that don't stretch well.Tired or weak muscles are more likely to be injured. Muscles with poor flexibility might not be able to bear the force of the action that certain activities require.Muscle imbalance.Although not all experts agree, some suggest that a muscle imbalance may lead to a hamstring injury. If the quadricep muscles along the front of the thigh are stronger and more developed than the hamstring muscles, injury to the hamstring muscles might be more likely.Age.Risk of injury increases with age.","A hamstring injury typically causes a sudden, sharp pain in the back of the thigh. There might also be a ""popping"" or tearing sensation."

This most serious form of heat injury, heatstroke, can occur if your body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher. The condition is most common in the summer months.","High body temperature.A core body temperature of 104 F (40 C) or higher, obtained with a rectal thermometer, is the main sign of heatstroke.Altered mental state or behavior.Confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and coma can all result from heatstroke.Alteration in sweating.In heatstroke brought on by hot weather, your skin will feel hot and dry to the touch. However, in heatstroke brought on by strenuous exercise, your skin may feel dry or slightly moist.Nausea and vomiting.You may feel sick to your stomach or vomit.Flushed skin.Your skin may turn red as your body temperature increases.Rapid breathing.Your breathing may become rapid and shallow.Racing heart rate.Your pulse may significantly increase because heat stress places a tremendous burden on your heart to help cool your body.Headache.Your head may throb.",Heatstroke signs and symptoms include:
691,Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding),"Menorrhagia is the medical term for menstrual periods with abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding. Although heavy menstrual bleeding is a common concern, most women don't experience blood loss severe enough to be defined as menorrhagia.","Soaking through one or more sanitary pads or tampons every hour for several consecutive hoursNeeding to use double sanitary protection to control your menstrual flowNeeding to wake up to change sanitary protection during the nightBleeding for longer than a weekPassing blood clots larger than a quarterRestricting daily activities due to heavy menstrual flowSymptoms of anemia, such as tiredness, fatigue or shortness of breath",Signs and symptoms of menorrhagia may include:
692,Plantar fasciitis,Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation of the fibrous tissue (plantar fascia) along the bottom of your foot that connects your heel bone to your toes. Plantar fasciitis can cause intense heel pain.,"Age.Plantar fasciitis is most common in people between the ages of 40 and 60.Certain types of exercise.Activities that place a lot of stress on your heel and attached tissue — such as long-distance running, ballet dancing and aerobic dance — can contribute to the onset of plantar fasciitis.Foot mechanics.Flat feet, a high arch or even an atypical pattern of walking can affect the way weight is distributed when you're standing and can put added stress on the plantar fascia.Obesity.Excess pounds put extra stress on your plantar fascia.Occupations that keep you on your feet.Factory workers, teachers and others who spend most of their work hours walking or standing on hard surfaces can be at increased risk of plantar fasciitis.","Plantar fasciitis typically causes a stabbing pain in the bottom of your foot near the heel. The pain is usually the worst with the first few steps after awakening, although it can also be triggered by long periods of standing or when you get up from sitting."
693,Hemangioma,An infantile hemangioma is a birthmark that is made up of a dense group of blood vessels. It often appears on the surface of the skin as a spongy mass.,HemangiomaInfantile hemangiomas — also known as strawberry birthmarks,"A hemangioma may be visible at birth, but it appears more often during the first month of life. It starts as a flat red mark on the body, most often on the face, scalp, chest or back. A child generally only has one mark, but some children may have more than one mark."
694,Intracranial hematoma,"An intracranial hematoma is a collection of blood within the skull. It's usually caused by a blood vessel that bursts in the brain. It may also be caused by trauma such as a car accident or fall. The blood may collect in the brain tissue or underneath the skull, pressing on the brain.",Headache that gets worseVomitingDrowsiness and progressive loss of consciousnessDizzinessConfusionUnequal pupil sizeSlurred speechLoss of movement (paralysis) on the opposite side of the body from the head injury,"You might develop signs and symptoms of an intracranial hematoma right after a head injury, or they may take weeks or longer to appear. You might seem fine after a head injury. This period is called the lucid interval."
695,Blood in urine (hematuria),"It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. In many cases, the cause is harmless. But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.","Urinary tract infections (UTIs).These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder.UTIscan cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With aUTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too.Kidney infection.This type ofUTIalso is called pyelonephritis.Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that otherUTIscan. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin.A bladder or kidney stone.The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones.The stones are often painless. But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab.Enlarged prostate.The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms.Kidney disease.Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed.Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes. Or it can happen on its own.Cancer.Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better.Inherited illnesses.A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine.Kidney injury.A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine.Medicines. The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause.Hard exercise.Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football. It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit. Blood in urine also can happen with long-distance sports, such as marathon running, but it's less clear why. It may be linked to bladder damage or other reasons that don't involve an injury. When hard exercise causes blood in urine, it may go away on its own within a week.If you see blood in your urine after exercise, don't assume it's from exercising. See your health care provider.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red."
696,Hemifacial spasm,Hemifacial spasm is a nervous system condition in which the muscles on one side of the face twitch.

922,Metachromatic leukodystrophy,"Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a rare hereditary (genetic) disorder that causes fatty substances (lipids) to build up in cells, particularly in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. This buildup is caused by a deficiency of an enzyme that helps break down lipids called sulfatides. The brain and nervous system progressively lose function because the substance that covers and protects the nerve cells (myelin) is damaged.","Loss of the ability to detect sensations, such as touch, pain, heat and soundLoss of intellectual, thinking and memory skillsLoss of motor skills, such as walking, moving, speaking and swallowingStiff, rigid muscles, poor muscle function and paralysisLoss of bladder and bowel functionGallbladder problemsBlindnessHearing lossSeizuresEmotional and behavioral problems, including unstable emotions and substance misuse","Damage to the protective myelin covering the nerves results in progressive worsening of brain and nervous system functions, including:"

But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.","Urinary tract infections (UTIs).These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder.UTIscan cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With aUTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too.Kidney infection.This type ofUTIalso is called pyelonephritis.Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that otherUTIscan. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin.A bladder or kidney stone.The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones.The stones are often painless. But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab.Enlarged prostate.The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms.Kidney disease.Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed.Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes. Or it can happen on its own.Cancer.Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better.Inherited illnesses.A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine.Kidney injury.A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine.Medicines. The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause.Hard exercise.Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football. It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit. Blood in urine also can happen with long-distance sports, such as marathon running, but it's less clear why. It may be linked to bladder damage or other reasons that don't involve an injury. When hard exercise causes blood in urine, it may go away on its own within a week.If you see blood in your urine after exercise, don't assume it's from exercising. See your health care provider.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red."

Because symptoms usually get better with rest, muscle weakness can come and go. However, the symptoms tend to progress over time. They usually reach their worst within a few years after the disease begins."
962,Myelodysplastic syndromes,Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of disorders caused by blood cells that are poorly formed or don't work properly.

This can cause serious problems in their daily routine.,"Excessive daytime sleepiness.People with narcolepsy fall asleep without warning. It can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when you're bored or during a task. For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly fall asleep. It can be especially dangerous if you fall asleep while driving. You might fall asleep for only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, you'll often feel refreshed but you'll get sleepy again.You also may experience a decrease in how alert and focused you feel during the day. Daytime sleepiness often is the first symptom to appear. Feeling sleepy makes it hard to focus and function.Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, you may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. You might continue to perform that task while asleep. When you awaken, you can't remember what you did, and you probably didn't do it well.Sudden loss of muscle tone.This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles. Symptoms may last up to a few minutes.Cataplexy can't be controlled. It's triggered by intense emotions. Often the emotions that cause cataplexy are positive. Laughter or excitement may cause the symptoms. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall.Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms.Sleep paralysis.People with narcolepsy often experience sleep paralysis.

You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward.Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy.Hallucinations.Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, you might feel as if there is a stranger in your bedroom. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming.Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REMsleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enterREMsleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly toREMsleep. They tend to enterREMsleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep.REMsleep also can happen at any time of the day.",The symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years of the disorder. Then they continue for life. They include:

986,Neurofibroma,,,
987,Neurofibromatosis,"Neurofibromatoses are a group of genetic disorders that cause tumors to form on nerve tissue. These tumors can develop anywhere in the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and nerves. There are three types of neurofibromatosis: neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis. NF1 is usually diagnosed in childhood, while NF2 and schwannomatosis are usually diagnosed in early adulthood.","Flat, light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots).These harmless spots are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spots suggestsNF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing.Freckling in the armpits or groin area.Freckling usually appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds.Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules).These harmless nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas).These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age.Bone deformities.Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg.Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma).These tumors usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults.Learning disabilities.Impaired thinking skills are common in children who haveNF1but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.Larger than average head size.Children withNF1tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.Short stature.Children who haveNF1often are below average in height.","There are three types of neurofibromatosis, each with different signs and symptoms."
988,Acoustic neuroma,"An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a noncancerous tumor. It develops on the balance nerve, known as the vestibular nerve, and on the auditory nerve, known as the cochlear nerve. These nerves lead from your inner ear to the brain, as shown in the top image. The pressure on the nerve from the tumor may cause hearing loss and imbalance. In some cases, the tumor may grow and affect the cerebellum or other brain tissues, as shown in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and illustrations above.","Hearing loss, usually gradually over months to years. In rare cases, hearing loss can be sudden. Hearing loss usually occurs on one side or is worse on one side.Ringing in the affected ear, known as tinnitus.Loss of balance or not feeling steady.Dizziness.Facial numbness and, very rarely, weakness or loss of muscle movement.","Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. Symptoms may occur because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves.

1010,Obesity,"Obesity is a complex disease involving having too much body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It's a medical problem that increases the risk of many other diseases and health problems. These can include heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, sleep apnea and certain cancers.",Obesity care at Mayo ClinicWhat is insulin resistance? A Mayo Clinic expert explains,"Body mass index, known as BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity. To calculate BMI, multiply weight in pounds by 703, divide by height in inches and then divide again by height in inches. Or divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. There are several online calculators available that help calculate BMI."
1011,Childhood obesity,"Childhood obesity is a serious medical condition that affects children and adolescents. It's particularly troubling because the extra pounds often start children on the path to health problems that were once considered adult problems — diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Childhood obesity can also lead to poor self-esteem and depression.","Diet.Regularly eating high-calorie foods, such as fast foods, baked goods and vending machine snacks, can cause your child to gain weight. Candy and desserts also can cause weight gain, and more and more evidence points to sugary drinks, including fruit juices and sports drinks, as culprits in obesity in some people.Lack of exercise.Children who don't exercise much are more likely to gain weight because they don't burn as many calories. Too much time spent in sedentary activities, such as watching television or playing video games, also contributes to the problem. TV shows also often feature ads for unhealthy foods.Family factors.If your child comes from a family of overweight people, he or she may be more likely to put on weight. This is especially true in an environment where high-calorie foods are always available and physical activity isn't encouraged.Psychological factors.Personal, parental and family stress can increase a child's risk of obesity. Some children overeat to cope with problems or to deal with emotions, such as stress, or to fight boredom. Their parents might have similar tendencies.Socioeconomic factors.People in some communities have limited resources and limited access to supermarkets. As a result, they might buy convenience foods that don't spoil quickly, such as frozen meals, crackers and cookies. Also, people who live in lower income neighborhoods might not have access to a safe place to exercise.Certain medications.Some prescription drugs can increase the risk of developing obesity. They include prednisone, lithium, amitriptyline, paroxetine (Paxil), gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant) and propranolol (Inderal, Hemangeol).",Not all children carrying extra pounds are overweight. Some children have larger than average body frames. And children normally carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. So you might not know by how your child looks if weight is a health concern.

1022,Jaw tumors and cysts,"Jaw tumors and cysts are relatively rare growths or lesions that develop in the jawbone or the soft tissues in the mouth and face. Jaw tumors and cysts — sometimes referred to as odontogenic or nonodontogenic, depending on their origin — can vary greatly in size and severity. These growths are usually noncancerous (benign), but they can be aggressive and expand, displace or destroy the surrounding bone, tissue and teeth.","Ameloblastoma.This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence.Central giant cell granuloma.Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment.Dentigerous cyst.This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth.Odontogenic keratocyst.This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.Odontogenic myxoma.This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment.Odontoma.This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes.Other types of cysts and tumors.These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others.",A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue.

Injuries include tears in the perineum ⸺ the skin between the vagina and the anus ⸺ that extend to the bowel or an infection. Fistulas caused by injuries during childbirth may involve injury to the anal sphincter ⸺ the rings of muscle at the end of the rectum that help hold in stool.Inflammatory bowel disease.The second most common cause of rectovaginal fistulas is Crohn's disease and, more rarely, ulcerative colitis. These inflammatory bowel diseases cause swelling and irritation of the tissues lining the digestive tract. Most people with Crohn's disease never develop a rectovaginal fistula, but having Crohn's disease does increase your risk of the condition.Cancer or radiation treatment in the pelvic area.A cancerous tumor in your rectum, cervix, vagina, uterus or anal canal can result in a rectovaginal fistula. Also, radiation therapy for cancers in these areas can put you at risk. A fistula caused by radiation can form at any time following radiation treatment, but most commonly forms within the first two years.Surgery involving the vagina, perineum, rectum or anus.In rare cases, prior surgery in your lower pelvic area, such as removing an infected Bartholin's gland, can cause a fistula to develop. Bartholin's glands are found on each side of the vaginal opening and help keep the vagina moist. The fistula may develop as a result of an injury during surgery or a leak or infection that develops afterward.Complication from diverticulitis.Infection of small, bulging pouches in your digestive tract, called diverticulitis, may cause the rectum or large intestine to stick to the vagina and may lead to a fistula.Other causes.Rarely, a rectovaginal fistula may develop following infections in the skin around the anus or vagina.","The most common symptom of a rectovaginal fistula is passing gas or stool from the vagina. Depending on the fistula's size and location, you may have only minor symptoms. Or you may have significant problems with stool and gas leakage and keeping the area clean."
1209,Recurrent breast cancer,"Recurrent breast cancer is breast cancer that comes back after initial treatment.

1211,Vesicoureteral reflux,"Your urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine. The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper abdomen. They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine. Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder. These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate. Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra.","A strong, persistent urge to urinateA burning sensation when urinatingThe need to pass small amounts of urine frequentlyCloudy urineFeverPain in your side (flank) or abdomen","Urinary tract infections commonly occur in people with vesicoureteral reflux. A urinary tract infection (UTI) doesn't always cause noticeable signs and symptoms, though most people have some."
1212,Aortic valve regurgitation,"In aortic valve regurgitation, the aortic valve doesn't close properly, causing blood to flow backward from the body's main artery (aorta) into the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle).","Shortness of breath with exercise or when you lie downFatigue and weakness, especially when you increase your activity levelHeart murmurIrregular pulse (arrhythmia)Lightheadedness or faintingChest pain (angina), discomfort or tightness, often increasing during exerciseSensations of a rapid, fluttering heartbeat (palpitations)Swollen ankles and feet","Most often, aortic valve regurgitation develops gradually. You may have no signs or symptoms for years. You may be unaware that you have the condition. However, sometimes aortic valve regurgitation occurs suddenly, usually as a result of an infection of the valve."
1213,Mitral valve regurgitation,"Mitral valve regurgitation is a type of heart valve disease in which the valve between the left heart chambers doesn't close completely, allowing blood to leak backward across the valve. It is the most common type of heart valve disease (valvular heart disease). If the leakage is severe, not enough blood will move through the heart or to the rest of the body. As a result, mitral valve regurgitation can make you feel very tired (fatigued) or short of breath.","Sound of blood flow across the valve (heart murmur)Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)Shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially when lying downSensation of a rapid, pounding or fluttering heartbeat (palpitations)Swollen feet or ankles (edema)",Mitral valve regurgitation is often mild and progresses slowly.

In time, signs and symptoms may develop, including:"
1217,Acute kidney failure,"The kidneys remove waste and excess fluid from the blood through structures called nephrons. Each nephron contains a filter called a glomerulus that has a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. When blood flows into a glomerulus, tiny molecules — water, essential minerals and nutrients, and wastes — pass through the capillary walls. Large molecules, such as proteins and red blood cells, do not. The filtered solution then passes into another part of the nephron called the tubule. The water, nutrients and minerals that the body needs are transferred back to the bloodstream. The excess water and waste become urine that flows to the bladder.","Decreased urine output, although occasionally urine output remains normalFluid retention, causing swelling in your legs, ankles or feetShortness of breathFatigueConfusionNauseaWeaknessIrregular heartbeatChest pain or pressureSeizures or coma in severe cases",Signs and symptoms of acute kidney failure may include:

Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, you might feel as if there is a stranger in your bedroom. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming.Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.REMsleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enterREMsleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly toREMsleep.

These tubes are called the ureters. The bladder stores urine until it's time to urinate. Urine leaves the body through another small tube called the urethra.",PainChanges in how much urine you produce (urine output)Difficulty urinatingBlood in the urineUrinary tract infectionsHigh blood pressure (hypertension),"Ureteral obstruction might have no signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms depend on where the obstruction occurs, whether it's partial or complete, how quickly it develops, and whether it affects one or both kidneys."
1471,Urethral stricture,"A urethral (u-REE-thrul) stricture involves scarring that narrows the tube that carries urine out of your body (urethra). A stricture restricts the flow of urine from the bladder and can cause a variety of medical problems in the urinary tract, including inflammation or infection.","Decreased urine streamIncomplete bladder emptyingSpraying of the urine streamDifficulty, straining or pain when urinatingIncreased urge to urinate or more-frequent urinationUrinary tract infection",Signs and symptoms of urethral stricture include:
1472,Urinary incontinence,Urinary incontinence — the loss of bladder control — is a common and often embarrassing problem. The severity ranges from occasionally leaking urine when you cough or sneeze to having an urge to urinate that's so sudden and strong you don't get to a toilet in time.,"Stress incontinence.Urine leaks when you exert pressure on your bladder by coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising or lifting something heavy.Urge incontinence.You have a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine. You may need to urinate often, including throughout the night. Urge incontinence may be caused by a minor condition, such as infection, or a more severe condition such as a neurological disorder or diabetes.Overflow incontinence.You experience frequent or constant dribbling of urine due to a bladder that doesn't empty completely.Functional incontinence.A physical or mental impairment keeps you from making it to the toilet in time. For example, if you have severe arthritis, you may not be able to unbutton your pants quickly enough.Mixed incontinence.You experience more than one type of urinary incontinence — most often this refers to a combination of stress incontinence and urge incontinence.","Many people experience occasional, minor leaks of urine. Others may lose small to moderate amounts of urine more frequently."
1473,Urinary tract infection (UTI),"Your urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. The urinary system removes waste from the body through urine. The kidneys are located toward the back of the upper abdomen. They filter waste and fluid from the blood and produce urine. Urine moves from the kidneys through narrow tubes to the bladder.

When they do, they may include:"
1475,Urine color,Regular urine color ranges from clear to pale yellow. But certain things can change the color.,Red.Blue.Green.Orange.Dark brown.Cloudy white.,"The regular color of urine varies. It depends on how much water you drink. Fluids dilute the yellow pigments in urine. So the more you drink, the clearer your urine looks. When you drink less, the yellow color becomes stronger."
1476,Blood in urine (hematuria),"It can be scary to see blood in urine, also called hematuria. In many cases, the cause is harmless. But blood in urine also can be a sign of a serious illness.","Urinary tract infections (UTIs).These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder.UTIscan cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With aUTI, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too.Kidney infection.This type ofUTIalso is called pyelonephritis.Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that otherUTIscan. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin.A bladder or kidney stone.The minerals in urine can form crystals on the walls of the kidneys or bladder. Over time, the crystals can become small, hard stones.The stones are often painless. But they can hurt a lot if they cause a blockage or leave the body through urine. Bladder or kidney stones can cause blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye as well as bleeding that can be seen only in the lab.Enlarged prostate.The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms.Kidney disease.Blood in urine that can be seen only in the lab is a common symptom of a kidney disease called glomerulonephritis. With this disease, the tiny filters in the kidneys that remove waste from blood become inflamed.Glomerulonephritis may be part of a condition that affects the whole body, such as diabetes. Or it can happen on its own.Cancer.Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better.Inherited illnesses.A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine.Kidney injury.A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine.Medicines. The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause.Hard exercise.Blood in the urine can happen after playing contact sports, such as football. It may be linked to bladder damage caused by getting hit. Blood in urine also can happen with long-distance sports, such as marathon running, but it's less clear why. It may be linked to bladder damage or other reasons that don't involve an injury. When hard exercise causes blood in urine, it may go away on its own within a week.If you see blood in your urine after exercise, don't assume it's from exercising. See your health care provider.","Blood in the urine can look pink, red or cola-colored. Red blood cells cause the urine to change color. It takes only a small amount of blood to turn urine red."

Possible signs and symptoms may include:
1492,Varicose veins,"Typically, veins return blood from the rest of the body to the heart. To return blood to the heart, the veins in the legs must work against gravity. Weakened valves, also called incompetent valves, within the veins might cause varicose veins. The weakened valves let blood pool in the veins instead of traveling to the heart. When blood pools in the veins, the veins become larger, making them show under the skin.","Veins that are dark purple or blueVeins that appear twisted and bulging, often appearing like cords on the legs","Spider veins appear as thin, red lines or as weblike networks of blood vessels on the surface of the skin.

1525,Wrinkles,"Wrinkles, especially around the eyes, mouth and neck, are common with aging as the skin in these areas gets thinner, drier and less elastic.","Age.As you get older, your skin naturally becomes less elastic and more fragile. Decreased production of natural oils dries your skin and makes it appear more wrinkled.Fat in the deeper layers of your skin diminishes. This causes loose, saggy skin and more-pronounced lines and crevices.Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light.Ultraviolet radiation, which speeds the natural aging process, is the primary cause of early wrinkling. Exposure toUVlight breaks down your skin's connective tissue — collagen and elastin fibers, which lie in the deeper layer of skin (dermis).Without the supportive connective tissue, your skin loses strength and flexibility. Skin then begins to sag and wrinkle prematurely.Smoking.Smoking can accelerate the normal aging process of your skin, contributing to wrinkles. This may be due to smoking's effect on collagen.Repeated facial expressions.Facial movements and expressions, such as squinting or smiling, lead to fine lines and wrinkles. Each time you use a facial muscle, a groove forms beneath the surface of the skin. And as skin ages, it loses its flexibility and is no longer able to spring back in place. These grooves then become permanent features on your face.","With repeated sun exposure, wrinkles can become very pronounced and deep, especially on the back of the neck."

1527,Wrist pain,"Wrist pain is often caused by sprains or fractures from sudden injuries. But wrist pain also can result from long-term problems, such as repetitive stress, arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.","Sudden impacts.Wrist injuries often occur when you fall forward onto your outstretched hand. This can cause sprains, strains and even fractures. A scaphoid fracture involves a bone on the thumb side of the wrist. This type of fracture may not show up on X-rays immediately after the injury.Repetitive stress.Any activity that involves wrist motion that you do again and again can inflame the tissues around joints or cause stress fractures. Some examples include hitting a tennis ball, bowing a cello or driving cross-country. The risk of injury is increased when you perform the movement for hours on end without a break. De Quervain tenosynovitis is a repetitive stress injury that causes pain at the base of the thumb.","Wrist pain may vary, depending on the cause. For example, osteoarthritis pain often is described as being similar to a dull toothache. Carpal tunnel syndrome usually causes a pins-and-needles feeling. This tingling sensation usually occurs in the thumb and index and middle fingers, especially at night. The precise location of wrist pain also provides clues to what's behind the symptoms."
